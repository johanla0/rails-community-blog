# To learn more, please read the Rails Internationalization guide
#
# en:
#   "true": "foo"
#
# Instead, surround them with single quotes.
#
# true, false, on, off, yes, no
#
# The following keys must be escaped otherwise they will not be retrieved by
# the default I18n backend:
#
# This would use the information in config/locales/es.yml.
#
#     I18n.locale = :es
#
# To use a different locale, set it with `I18n.locale`:
#
#     <%= t("hello") %>
#
# In views, this is aliased to just `t`:
#
#     I18n.t "hello"
#
# To use the locales, use `I18n.t`:
# Files in the config/locales directory are used for internationalization
# and are automatically loaded by Rails. If you want to use locales other
# than English, add the necessary files in this directory.
